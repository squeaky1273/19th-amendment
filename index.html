            <p class="lead">It all started with the Sufrage Movement, many women of color were discriminated</p>
            <p class="lead">The Sufrage Movement started in New York and it was a big attraction for a wide range of women, even though a lot of women were attracted to this movement they usually excluded colored women. There were two really important women that participated in this movement, Sarah J.S. Garnet she founded the Equal Suffrage League in the late 1880s and Mabel Lee who was in charge of leading the contingent of Chinese and Chinese American women in a suffrage parade.</p>
